1) Install with make

2) Try the command

   make test

   This compiles test/eg_test1.erl, ... test/eg_test7.erl and runs them to
   generate test/eg_test1.pdf, ... test/eg_test7.pdf. See these modules
   for examples of how to use erlguten from an Erlang program.

   Note: The main module 'erlguten.erl' was intended as a batch interface,
   using xml files as input (see test/test1.xml), but it never reached a stable
   state and is not fit for use. The shell wrapper script 'erlguten' expects to
   use this interface, but doesn't in fact work. Contributions are welcome.
